- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mendiz-Fern
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, particularly Language Models (basic, I know) and Computer Vision but I'd also love to learn about making more efficient models.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn more about Network protocols, cryptography, and app development. Also thinking about VR game development, but haven't really started on that yet. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Nothing Right now, thanks. I'm decently busy.
- 📫 How to reach me- if necessary, you may reach me at mendizfern@gmail.com
- Note: My computer died in February 2024 and its SSD was lost to the flood (I spilled some water on my laptop) so I lost about 3 large projects and other non-backed up files. Lovely, I know.
